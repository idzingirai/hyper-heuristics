Run the "main.py" file in the src directory using the following command `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`.

To change the problem instance to run and seed, please open the config.py file and do the following:
- change the value of SEED to the desired seed value
- change the value of PROBLEM_INSTANCE_INDEX to the desired problem instance (if the problem instance is comp08.ctt.txt, the value of the index is 7)

Alternatively, you can run the hyper-heuristic using the following command `python main.py <seed> <problem_instance_index>` or `python3 main.py <seed> <problem_instance_index>`.
