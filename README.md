Please note that the code was run on Windows 11 using Python 3.11.4 and PyCharm 2021.1.3 (Professional Edition).

To run the hyper-heuristic, please ensure you are in the src/ directory.

Run the "main.py" file in the src directory using the following command `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`.

To change the problem instance to run and seed, please open the config.py file and do the following:
- change the value of SEED to the desired seed value
- change the value of PROBLEM_INSTANCE_INDEX to the desired problem instance (if the problem instance is comp08.ctt.txt, the value of the index is 7)

The report is in the directory reports/Assignment 1 and is named "u20536951 - Assignment 1 Report.pdf".

The timetables for each run and for each problem instance are in the directory solutions directory. E.g. for all solutions for comp01, they are in the solutions/comp01 directory
